# sensor_fusion--Modified

Content with the projects of Udacity Sensor fusion.

There are two codes compiled after make: ./environment and ./main_env

I created ./main_env because I tried to make something clean and straight to the point.

Due to short time, i didn't finish main_processPcl.cpp, which is my new version of processPointCloud.cpp, and must confess that I didn't understand 
perfectly about what was expected related to RANSAC and Euclidean Clustering. So, I did what I believe is correct, and anything that you see that is 
incorrect, please notify me.
