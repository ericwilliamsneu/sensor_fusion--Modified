Directory with the projects of Udacity Sensor fusion Nanodegree.

## 1. LiDAR Obstacle Detection

There are three codes compiled after make: ./environment, ./main_env and ./main_env2

I created ./main_env because I tried to make something clean and straight to the point. You can run it. It's working perfectly. The ./main_env2 is the second try after Udacity's correction.

Correspondency:
main_env2.cpp = environment.cpp
main_processPcl.cpp = processPointClouds.cpp
main_processPcl.h = processPointClouds.h

I've altered CmakeLists.txt, so pay attention before start.

## 2. Camera

Soon.

## 3. Radar

Soon.

## 4. Kalman Filters

Soon.
